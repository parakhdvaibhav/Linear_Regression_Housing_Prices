# Simple Linear Regression Project

## Business Problem: 

An E-commerce company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They sell clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
